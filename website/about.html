<h2> Overview</h2>

<div class="tabcontent">
<p>Decap is a binary code analysis tool that automatically deprivileges programs by identifying the subset of
capabilities they require based on the system calls they may invoke. This is made possible by our systematic effort in deriving a complete
mapping between all Linux system calls related to privileged operations and the corresponding capabilities on which they depend. We suggest reading our  
<a href="https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~mdhasan/papers/decap.raid22.pdf">paper</a> for more details.

<h2> System call - Capability Mapping</h2>
</div>
		
<div class="tabcontent">
<p>We performed a thorough investigation
of all available Linux capabilities and the system calls they affect,
to derive a detailed and complete mapping between all system calls
related to privileged operations and their respective capabilities. The complete mapping can be found 
<a href="https://hasanmdme.github.io/decap/website/syscall-capabilitymappingtable.html">here</a>, 
and a visual representation of the mapping is available 
<a href="https://hasanmdme.github.io/decap/website/syscall-capabilitymapping.html">here</a>.

<h2> System call Identification and Capability Enforcement</h2>
</div>
		
<div class="tabcontent">
<p>The first step in deprivileging a setuid program is to identify its
required system calls. Decap performs static binary code analysis of a target program and its libraries to extract the set
of all possible system calls it may invoke, and then to derive and enforce the corresponding set of required capabilities. Decap relies on both 
<a href="https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~sghavamnia/papers/confine.raid20.pdf">Confine</a> 
and 
<a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~vpk/papers/sysfilter.raid20.pdf">Sysfilter</a> 
to identify the system calls required by a given application. Also, CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability is
required by multiple system calls but only when invoked with a
limited set of specific argument values. Therefore, once the set of
required system calls has been extracted, Decap performs argumentlevel
analysis for those system calls that conditionally require
CAP_SYS_ADMIN, and attempts to extract the concrete values passed
to the arguments that determine whether CAP_SYS_ADMIN is required, across all their call sites. 
Decap identifies the required capabilities for an application based on the system call analysis and the
previously generated mapping. Finally, it reduces the privileges by first deprivileging the target
application entirely by removing its setuid bit, and then granting
only the capabilities that the program actually requires.
